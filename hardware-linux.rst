Hardware Wallets on Linux
=========================

The following aims to be a concise guide of what you need to get your
hardware wallet working with Electrum-Dime.

If you use the AppImage, that already has all the dependencies and Python
libraries bundled with it, so skip the first two steps.

1. Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently all hardware wallets depend on ``hidapi``, to be able to build
that, you need:

*ubuntu:*
::

   sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev
   
*fedora:*
::

   sudo dnf install libusb-devel systemd-devel

(Package names may be different for other distributions.)

2. Python Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then, depending on the device you have, you need a python package
(typically a library by the manufacturer).
For a usually more up-to-date list (including potential version requirements), refer to
`requirements-hw.txt <https://github.com/dime-coin/electrum-dimecoin/blob/master/contrib/requirements/requirements-hw.txt>`_
in the client source.
